# Wikki app with Sinatra

In this course will be building a wiki app. Our wiki's going to load pages from simple text files that are saved in the project directory.

While building this project we've learned:

* HTTP, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests
* The paths each request includes
* Using those request types and paths to set up Sinatra routes
* Embedding data in the ERB templates
* Using URL and form parameters to save data and serving static files including CSS style sheets.
* Using ERB layouts to get rid of duplicated template code.
